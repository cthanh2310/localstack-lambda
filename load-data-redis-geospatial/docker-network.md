To move a Docker container to a different network, you'll need to disconnect it from the current network (if applicable) and then connect it to the new network. Here's how you can do this:

### 1. **Create or Identify the Network**

If you don't have the network already created, you can create one:

```bash
docker network create <network_name>
```

### 2. **Disconnect the Container from its Current Network**

If the container is already connected to a network, you can disconnect it using:

```bash
docker network disconnect <current_network_name> <container_name_or_id>
```

### 3. **Connect the Container to the New Network**

After disconnecting, or if you just want to add the container to a new network:

```bash
docker network connect <new_network_name> <container_name_or_id>
```

### Example

Suppose you have a container named `my_container` and you want to move it from the `bridge` network to a network named `my_network`:

1. **Create the new network** (if it doesn’t already exist):

   ```bash
   docker network create my_network
   ```

2. **Disconnect the container from the current network**:

   ```bash
   docker network disconnect bridge my_container
   ```

3. **Connect the container to the new network**:

   ```bash
   docker network connect my_network my_container
   ```

### 4. **Verify the Network Connection**

To ensure the container is now connected to the correct network:

```bash
docker network inspect my_network
```

This command will show you the containers connected to `my_network` and confirm that `my_container` is listed there.e new network**:

   ```bash
   docker network connect my_network my_container
